                    <p class="mt-8 mb-11">Unlike personal injury, medical malpractice or other lawsuits to address a “physical” injury, an employment claim rest on your ability to prove that you suffered unfair treatment in the workplace.</p>
                    <p class="mt-8 mb-11">Whether you characterize your employment status as an employee, independent contractor, or business partnership owner, the protection of your income, position, opportunity for advancement, and professional reputation are extremely important.</p>
                    <p class="mt-8 mb-11">You have rights to protect your employment environment, your current position and potential advancement, and unfair treatment because of discrimination, disparate treatment, harassment, and wrongful termination, because of race, sex, sexual orientation, ethnicity (cultural differences) or religion.</p>
                    <p class="mt-8 mb-11">As an experienced employment litigation attorney, I have successfully represented a variety of employees in federal and state courts, as well as administrative claims adjudicated by the EEOC, IDHR and in arbitration proceedings.</p>
                    <p class="mt-8 mb-11">I have also successfully represented professional clients in various arbitration and disciplinary hearings, as well as reviewed and negotiated favorable terms in severance agreements.</p>
                    <p class="mt-8 mb-11">Every employment situation is unique - involving unique personalities, responsibilities, job expectations and performance evaluations. Success in employment litigation often depends on your attorney’s ability to identify the nuances of your employment situation.</p>
                    <p class="mt-8 mb-11">An experienced attorney must have a clear understanding of how the relevant federal and state employment statutes, such as the FMLA, ADA, Title 42, Illinois Human Rights Act, and the Illinois Worker’s Compensation Act and other controlling legal precedent will protect you and permit the recovery of appropriate damages.</p>
